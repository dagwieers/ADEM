/* 
storeAndForwardBuf
is based on cbuf - circular buffer - impelementation with a few additions
it has a pointer to the next position to read after the peek, which can be
used in the forward mode to get the data and forward it to an external server.
Once tha ack (acknowledge) is received the ack function moves the begin pointer 
to the next pointer. nack reset the next pointer to the begin pointer.
The rest of the functionality is as in cbuf.

The class has been renamed from cbuf to storeAndForwardBuf
