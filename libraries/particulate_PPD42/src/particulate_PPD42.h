  Ppd42.h - Library for ADEM PPD42 sensor.

	You can test this library feeding a square wave with a known
	duty cycle into the PM10 input pin. The readPM10() function
	should return a value around 500000 for a 50% duty cycle
	square wave.
	
	Worked on an ESP8266 at 1% accuracy with duty cycles ranging
	from 20% to 80% between 1Hz and 33kHz. A 50% duty cycle at
	60kHz worked buth the ESP crashed at 70kHz, that's 140000
	interrupts per second!
